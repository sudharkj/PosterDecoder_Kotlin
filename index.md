# Poster Decoder (Kotlin)

Android app aimed at mimicking Camscanner kind of applications.

#### User Stories

* *Capture Image*: User goes to an event and looks at various posters. He likes a poster and captures it on his phone. Now, when the app loads, he is allowed to load any image he wants to edit, or the app allows him to capture an image using his default camera app.
* *Select Image Boundary (In Progress)*: User is allowed to select the boundary of poster and add contours around distorted regions in the image. A contour is defined as lines drawn by the user to select a region on image that is not flat.

**NOTE**: We faced some integration issue because of which we couldn't complete the second one that will be available by EOD today at max. Sorry for the delay.
